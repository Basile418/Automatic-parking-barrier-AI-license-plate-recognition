description of the automatic parking project

This project is carried out in a school environment, by fourth year students from the general engineering school ECAM Rennes.
The goal is to use the ESP32-cam module. We therefore chose to have automatic private parking. The camera therefore serves us to detect
the license plate of the car presented in front of the barrier.
